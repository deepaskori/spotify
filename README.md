This is a personal project that was meant to explore how we can use open-source, cutting-edge ml frameworks and customize them for more specific use cases. For example, here I used spotify's million playlist dataset to gather information about the names of tracks in playlists and the names people have chosen to give these playlists. Then, I finetuned Google's T5 (text to text transfer transformer) model on this data, retrieved playlists from my personal spotify account using spotify's web api, and subsequently generated possible names for my playlists.
